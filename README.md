# Facial-Exprssion-Recognition-using-keras


In this project we were to devise a model that can detect diffrent facial expressions.

There are 2 approaches:

# First approach : using a modified model
In this section ," train1.py", we used multilayer model with dropout in order to prevent overfitting.


# Second approache: using Transfer Learning

Transfer learning is one of the most usful architectures that would help us build our models with much lower modifications.

The notebook named " Facial expression3.ipynp "  is written in google colabrotary.
